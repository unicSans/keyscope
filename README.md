## Key Features

### Connectivity & Compatibility
* **Dual Support:** Fully compatible with both **Redis** and **Valkey** (detects version automatically).
* **Connection Modes:**
    * **Standalone:** Direct connection to single instances.
    * **Cluster:** Automatic topology discovery and redirection handling.
    * **Sentinel:** (Planned) Support for high-availability setups.
* **SSH Tunneling:** Built-in SSH tunneling support (Password & Key Pair auth) for secure remote access without external tools.

### Security
* **Secure Storage:** Passwords and private keys are never stored in plain text. Keyscope integrates with the **OS System Keychain** to keep your credentials safe.

### UI/UX
* **Native IDE Integration:** Built with Kotlin UI DSL to provide a seamless JetBrains look-and-feel (Dark/Light theme support).
* **Hierarchical Explorer:**
    * Tree-based navigation: `Server` → `Database` → `Data Type`.
    * Quickly identify key distribution by type (String, Hash, List, Set, ZSet, Stream).
* **Tabbed Workspace:** Open multiple database views simultaneously using the IDE's native tab system.

### Data Management & Viewer
* **Smart Data Viewer:**
    * **JSON Pretty Print:** Automatically detects JSON strings within keys and formats them for readability.
    * **Type-Specific Rendering:** Specialized views for Hashes, Lists, Sets, and Sorted Sets.
* **Performance:**
    * **Lazy Loading:** Uses `SCAN` cursors to handle millions of keys without freezing the UI.
    * **Type Filtering:** Server-side filtering using `SCAN ... TYPE` for efficient browsing.
* **Metadata:** Displays Key TTL (Time-To-Live), Type, and Size at a glance.

## Why Keyscope?

**Keyscope** is not just another Redis GUI client. It is a specialized tool designed to unlock the full potential of **Valkey**. We focus on modern developer experience (DX) and performance.

* **Built for Valkey and Redis**
    * Native support for Valkey's new threading model and data structures.
    * Visualized monitoring optimized for Valkey metrics.
* **Native Performance**
    * Built with **Kotlin** and the JetBrains SDK. No web views, no heavy frameworks, and no context switching. It is optimized for speed and minimal resource consumption.
* **Native Look & Feel**
    * We utilize the standard **JetBrains UI components**. Whether you are using the Darcula theme or the new UI, Keyscope blends in perfectly, providing a consistent and comfortable user experience, and an interface designed for long coding sessions.
* **Focus on Essentials**
    * Designed for developers who need to manage Valkey and Redis clusters without leaving their code.
