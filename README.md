## Why Keyscope?

**Keyscope** is not just another Redis GUI client. It is a specialized tool designed to unlock the full potential of **Valkey**. We focus on modern developer experience (DX) and performance.

### Key Features (*Planned*)

* **1-Click Cluster Setup (Docker-less)**
    * Deploy a production-ready **3 Master + 3 Replica** cluster on your local machine in seconds.
    * **No Docker Desktop required.** No complex `docker-compose` files. It just works.
* **Built for Valkey and Redis**
    * Native support for Valkey's new threading model and data structures.
    * Visualized monitoring optimized for Valkey metrics.
* **Native Performance**
    * Built with **Pure Java** and the JetBrains SDK. No web views, no heavy frameworks, and no context switching. It is optimized for speed and minimal resource consumption.
* **Native Look & Feel**
    * We utilize the standard **JetBrains UI components**. Whether you are using the Darkula theme or the new UI, Keyscope blends in perfectly, providing a consistent and comfortable user experience, and an interface designed for long coding sessions.
* **Focus on Essentials**
    * Designed for developers who need to manage Valkey and Redis clusters without leaving their code.

> **Note:** This plugin is **NOT** available for VS Code or Eclipse. It is a specialized tool for the JetBrains family.

## Pricing & Licensing

Keyscope is a paid plugin available via the **JetBrains Marketplace**. We believe in a fair "Try before you Buy" model.

* **30-Day Free Trial:** Full access to all features. No credit card required to start.
